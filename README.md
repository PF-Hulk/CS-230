## The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client aiming to expand their current game, *Draw It or Lose It*, which is currently available only on Android, into a web-based application. The goal is to create a scalable, multi-platform game that supports multiple teams and players simultaneously. The game must ensure unique identifiers for teams, players, and games, and also support real-time interaction across platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

## Strengths in Developing the Documentation
One of the key strengths I demonstrated in developing the documentation was clearly capturing the technical requirements and constraints. I focused on critical aspects such as cross-platform compatibility, real-time synchronization, and security measures. My attention to the design constraints and system architecture allowed me to structure the document clearly, offering valuable guidance for the development process.

## Helpful Aspects of the Design Document
Working through the design document made it easier to break down the complex requirements into smaller, actionable tasks. This proved very helpful in developing the code, as it allowed me to focus on key issues like generating unique identifiers and ensuring real-time communication between players. The design document gave me a roadmap that made the development process smoother and more organized.

## Areas for Revision
If I could revise any part of the design document, it would be the section on memory and resource management. I would add more depth on techniques for optimizing resource use, particularly when it comes to rendering images and managing multiple concurrent users. Providing more details about memory optimization for handling large data volumes during real-time gameplay would strengthen the document.

## Interpreting User Needs in the Design
The Gaming Roomâ€™s users need a reliable, scalable game that performs well across different platforms. By focusing on the requirements for real-time synchronization and scalability, I designed a solution that would meet user needs and ensure smooth gameplay. Prioritizing user experience is critical because the success of the game depends on its ability to meet user expectations without performance issues or delays.

## Approach to Software Design
My approach to software design focused on using proven patterns like the Singleton pattern for managing game instances and a microservices architecture for scalability. These techniques helped ensure that the application was modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. In the future, I would continue using these strategies and include more automated testing to identify potential issues earlier in the development process.
